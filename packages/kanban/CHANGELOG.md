# Changelog

[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 0.3.6

### Fixed

- Resolve `sessionController` lazily when switching a workflow session's model
  route. If the service is not published yet, keep the session's current route
  instead of failing the turn with `NO_SESSION_CONTROLLER`.

## 0.3.4

### Fixed

- Workflow sessions are no longer disposed when a ticket enters needs-attention;
  their Kanban action tools stay registered so a continued session can submit.
- Session attachment is a set per ticket/purpose. Reopened or manually continued
  sessions are reattached automatically via `agent/created`, restoring their
  Kanban tools.
- Action tools now support manually driven turns: when no engine turn waiter is
  present, implementation/review/plan submissions flow directly into the engine.
- Added a `recoverSession` action and a **Recover tools** button in the ticket's
  Sessions panel for an already-live stranded session.

## 0.3.3

### Changed

- New-ticket form redesigned as a centered modal; the whole client is
  restyled to the native DSH design language (design tokens, 14px/22px
  body, native buttons, 32px inputs, segmented controls and switches for
  the form's choices, dark mode via tokens). Field set, defaults and the
  create RPC payload are unchanged.

## 0.3.2

### Added

- Opt-in **Worktree** toggle in the new-ticket form, shown only when
  `dsh-better-git-worktree` is mounted. Confirming creates a managed working
  copy through that plugin's host service, registers it as a workspace, and
  points the ticket at it. The worktree copy is adopted by the first workflow
  session in the managed root.
- `capabilities` and `worktree` Kanban endpoints.

## 0.3.1

### Added

- Approval sessions have their own model route (`roles.approver`), editable in
  the Model routing tab. Both the production deployment and lab are configured
  to `local-ai-machine (apu)` / `big-moe`.

## 0.3.0

### Changed

- Removed the separate verification session. A passing review is validated in
  code against the plan's done_when ids and the acceptance criteria; incomplete
  reviews return to implementation. No verifier role or verification tool is
  registered.
- Added a human **Approval** stage. After review passes, the ticket becomes
  Needs Attention with approve, discard, and interactive-session actions.
- Approval sessions run in the standard preset, workspace-write, in the
  ticket's workspace. They expose `kanban_approve`, `kanban_discard`, and
  `kanban_submit_plan`; submitting a plan starts another build/review round.
- Review now emits per-condition done_when rows using the plan ids and
  acceptance_coverage for every acceptance statement.

## 0.2.5

### Fixed

- Workflow sessions now use DSH's canonical `session-<uuid>` ids and retry
  workspace attachment until the workspace registry is ready. Historical
  Kanban sessions are re-attached at boot, so they no longer show as Ungrouped.
- Restart recovery closes every open workflow session. A plan session that was
  interrupted by a restart marks the ticket needs-attention instead of silently
  launching another plan session; review/verify recover to implementation.
- Opening a ticket's plan session picks the latest plan session rather than the
  oldest one.

## 0.2.4

### Fixed

- A plan session waiting on a native `ask_user_question` now appears in the
  Needs Attention group/count with the red status styling. It returns to In
  Flight automatically once the question is answered; the ticket does not enter
  the stalled/retry path.

## 0.2.3

### Fixed

- The plan session's initial ticket state now includes the starting human
  acceptance criteria, so the planner can extend or fill them out with the
  starting point in view.

## 0.2.2

### Added

- Kanban sidebar link now shows board badges in the Activity-link style: a blue
  in-flight count and a red needs-attention count, polling the board every five
  seconds and using the same status colours as the board KPIs.

## 0.2.1

### Fixed

- Plan sessions run in the native **read-only** sandbox mode; review and
  verification also run read-only. Implementation runs in workspace-write.
  The ineffective custom tool mask was removed in favor of the native access
  mode plus the existing phase tool guard.
- Workflow sessions are attached to the selected workspace, so they appear
  under that workspace instead of Ungrouped.
- Workflow sessions pin their title (`KAN-n · purpose`) immediately, preventing
  the auxiliary session-title model call from creating a second activity lease.
- The plan prompt now includes only the ticket title and body, not the column,
  workspace path, or acceptance block.

## 0.2.0

### Changed

- Replaced phase JSON-in-message results with scoped action tools:
  `kanban_submit_plan`, `kanban_submit_implementation`,
  `kanban_submit_review` and `kanban_submit_verification`.
- Every workflow session now starts once in the **standard preset**. The plugin
  no longer registers per-role presets, rebinds presets mid-session, or provides
  a custom system prompt.
- Grill + plan is one flat session. Interactive mode uses the native
  `ask_user_question` tool; autonomous mode uses the self-judgement prompt.
- Implement + review share one session. Both action tools stay available and
  return errors when called in the wrong phase; write/edit are guarded off
  during review.
- Verify moved to the end and runs in its own session.
- Phase order is now `plan → implement → review → verify → closed`.
- New ticket choices: planning timing (`now` or `at_pickup`) and question mode
  (`interactive` or `autonomous`).
- Historical tickets/sessions are intentionally discarded by the V3 migration.
- Sessions close explicitly on plan/review/verify completion so continue-kicker
  sees a completed or aborted tail rather than an idle error.

## 0.1.5

### Fixed

- Human retry now resumes the failed phase instead of always forcing
  `implement`: failures in intake/triage/grill/plan re-enter those phases.
- Implementation refuses to start without at least one `done_when` condition and
  resets to planning (`done_when_required`), so a retry can never bypass plan and
  reach verification with an empty condition set.
- The lifecycle now permits the explicit replan reset from
  implement/verify/review back to triage.
- `needs_attention_reason` events record the failed phase.

## 0.1.4

### Fixed

- Restore the missing drag-event handlers (`startDrag`, `finishDrag`,
  `dragOverColumn`, `dragOverCard`, `dropCard`) that caused the Kanban page to
  crash with `ReferenceError: startDrag is not defined`.

## 0.1.3

### Added

- Dragging a ticket now renders a dashed shadow copy of the card in the target
  column at the hovered insertion point. The target column is outlined while
  hovered, so the drop destination is visible before release.
- Dropping a card onto a card in another column now moves it to that column
  before applying the within-column order.

## 0.1.2

### Fixed

- Phases with different model routes now switch the shared session through
  `ctx.sessionController.selectForNextRequest()` instead of the core agent
  registry, which does not expose that operation. This fixes the production
  plan transition failure (`this.agents.selectForNextRequest is not a function`).

## 0.1.1

### Fixed

- The orchestrator/judge now falls back to the deployment default model when
  `roles.orchestrator.provider/model` are unset, instead of failing with
  “no orchestrator route configured”. This matches the phase roles, which
  already inherited the default route.

## 0.1.0

### Added

- Ticket board (Backlog · Now · Blocked · Needs attention · Done/Discarded) and
  an in-flight view, backed by a local SQLite store with forward-only migrations.
- Code-driven lifecycle: intake, triage, grill, plan, implement, verify, review,
  with the intake-combination table enforced in the store.
- One **shared workflow session per ticket**: every phase is a turn in that
  session, with a phase-aware tool guard and a model-route switch between turns.
- New-ticket form asks for the workspace and initial status; the Host accepts
  `column: backlog|now|blocked`.
- Activity-dashboard visual language: KPI strip, colour-accented columns,
  lifecycle progress on cards, working-card glow, hero detail with a workflow
  timeline and metric cards, and clickable session links.
- Workflow timeline now shows plugin-owned phase blocks (grilling includes the
  human wait), separate orchestrator judge calls, and plugin command steps with
  individual colours; session tools/turns are no longer plotted. Clicking a block
  expands metadata; phase blocks include their prompt/result artifacts and the
  lifecycle events in that phase window, judge blocks include their verdict (and
  question for new runs), and `git diff` persists its output as a plugin artifact.
- Role presets are rebound per phase, changing the actual model-facing tool set
  (plus a global-tool mask); prompts were rewritten for the shared-session model.
- Per-ticket **ticket analytics** is ticket-scoped; the page-level Analytics
  button remains board-wide.
- Model routing is a top-right modal with one row per role and a single
  provider-grouped model picker. A pencil enters edit mode; saves persist the
  role routes to the profile config through `configEditor.edit`.
- Human-friendly token units (k/m), local routes price at $0.00, and a styled
  analytics dashboard with KPI cards and rate bars.
- Removed the remaining Kanban-side capacity coupling (`isWaitingForCapacity`,
  board capacity view/chips, legacy `maxConcurrent`); concurrency is entirely
  outside this plugin.
- Global per-provider capacity is delegated to `dsh-model-capacity`; Kanban owns
  no leases and no per-turn concurrency counters.
- Role sessions created from presets, with tool allow-lists enforced by
  `tools.restrict` and a monotonic execution guard.
- Mechanical result gate, bounded continuations, out-of-band adjudication,
  independent verifier and reviewer sessions, retry ladder and
  `needs_attention` packets.
- Span tree, token/cost ledger (`unpriced` never `$0.00`), JSONL/CSV export and
  analytics queries.
- Config in the profile YAML with strict boot validation, prompt hashing and
  atomic reload; no config table in SQLite.
